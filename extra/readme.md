## Color Spaces

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space

### sRGB

Standard RGB.

### HSV

Hue, saturation and value are independent channels.

### CMYK

For printing

### sRGB to Grayscale

non-uniform weighting of color channels, because of the different sensitivity of the human eye to different colors. Therefore, such a weighting ensures luminance preservation from RGB to grayscale.
